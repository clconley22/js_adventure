* variables --- need challenge to create a variable.

# Challenge 1 - choose the correct password to lower the drawbridge
- Create a const variable passwordOne and assign it to string "Insufficient facts always invite danger."
- Create a let variable called passwordTwo and assign it to string "Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on."
- Challenge 1 is to reassign the variable that can be reassigned to a new phrase: "Change is the essential process of all existence." and then console.log() to confirm it is reassigned.

#This will pass the first test, which is to go around a wall.  When they come across an obstacle, the screen should show some text explaining the level.

# Challenge 2 - melt the ice to get through the wall by converting
- Oh no!  Looks like we're going to need to generate 820 smarlfUnits (alien temperature units) to melt the ice to get through to the other side of this wall.
- Let's store our smarlfUnits in a constant variable.
- We know that 1 smarlfUnits = 4.45 Kelvin
- Well, I think we can get a Kelvin conversion with that information.  Let's store that in a constant variable called Kelvin. // [const kelvin = smarlfUnits * 4]
- Now since we know Kelvin, let's create a variable called Celsius. Celsius is Kelvin - 273.
- Wait...we also know Fahrenheit = Celsius * (9/5) + 32
- We can now store that in a const variable too called Fahrenheit
- Now, use a template literal to log this: "The temperature we need to melt the ice is TEMPERATURE smarlfUnits, or TEMPERATURE degrees Fahrenheit."
